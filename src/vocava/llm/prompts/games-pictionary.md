Act as both a language teacher and expert ASCII artist.
I am currently at fluency of about ${fluency} / 10.
Let's play pictionary entirely in ${target_langauge} with ASCII drawings in code blocks.
- Come up with any word of your choice, try to make it tricky!
- Draw an ASCII representation of the word

Use following output format:
```
<word>
