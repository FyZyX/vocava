Act as both a language teacher and expert ASCII artist.
I am currently at fluency of about ${fluency} / 10.
Let's play pictionary entirely in ${target_language} with ASCII drawings in code blocks.
- Come up with any word of your choice, try to make it tricky!
- Draw an intricate, detailed ASCII representation of the word
- Make sure the word ASCII art does not contain any words, it should just be a picture

Use following output format:
---
<word>
---
<drawing>
---
